Notes:

Use arrow keys to move around
Use F to shoot
Use shift to run

To play the game use the executable file in the zip called VarioTheGermanElectrian
Remember to extract the files or else the program will not reconize SDL
Look at the code in the files folder

I used SDL2 instead of OpenGL I hope that it is okay
I accidently confused SDL2 and OpenGL
